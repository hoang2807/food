          <p>
            Budget trip doesn’t mean boring! There are numerous places worth
            visiting even if you don’t have much money. The golden sands of
            Florida and California beckon you to their pristine shores, and
            invite you to relax. There are few people in winter, so hotels are
            more affordable to book than ever. San Diego has a bunch of holiday
            events going on, including their annual Parade of Lights on the
            bayfront, and Balboa Park decked out in holiday cheer. Los Angeles
            has so much to offer the holiday tourist as well!
          </p>
          <p>
            “Ten key services” have been framed through different combinations

            development of county level medical clusters
